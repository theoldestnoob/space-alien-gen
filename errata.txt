Errata / Deviations:

- Alien Creation II (GURPS Space pg. 143): 

    Ordinary Animals table lists Grazing/Browsing Herbivore, 
    Sapient Organisms table lists only Grazing Herbivore
        I have used Grazing/Browsing Herbivore for both
        
    Inconsistent naming for some habitats between text and tables
        I have used the versions in tables where there is a conflict
        
    I have named "Other" Autotroph "Exotic Autotroph"
    	
    *Separate tables for Ordinary and Sapient animals, 
     but Intelligence + Sapience rolled in Alien Creation IX 
     (GURPS Space pg. 168)
    *Possible resolution: Sapient table in Alien Creation III allows for 
        /possibility/ of sapience.
    *    Input whether Nonsapient, Possible Sapient, or Definitely Sapient
    *    Nonsapient: roll on tables for Ordinary Animal, 
            roll on Animal Intelligence table, 
            never produce sapient beings
    *    Possible: roll on tables for Sapient Animal, 
            roll of 13+ on Animal Intelligence table produce sapient beings
    *    Sapient: roll on tables for Sapient Animal, 
            skip Animal Intelligence table
    *    Rereading the tables makes it seem like this is intended behavior...
    
- Alien Creation III (GURPS Space pg. 149):

    Secondary Locomotion - Winged Flight Table has no results for a roll of 2
    	I have used Climbing for 2 as well

    Secondary Locomotion - Winged Flight Table has "slithering or sliding"
        I have removed "or sliding" to make further calculations easier

    Secondary Locomotion - Winged Flight Table has * for Slithering
        This can be reached from a land-habitat creature, for which there is
        no "Slithering" secondary locomotion table, so I ignore it if
        the habitat type is land

    Primary Locomotion Table lists "Lagoon", 
    Alien Creation II table contains "Tropical Lagoon"
        I have used "Tropical Lagoon"
        
    Primary Locomotion Table Lists "Lake/Salt-Water Sea", 
    Alien Creation II tables contains "Fresh-Water Lakes"
        I have used "Fresh-Water Lakes"
        
    Primary Locomotion Table - Mountain indicates a secondary locomotion 
    possibility for "Walking", there is no such table
        I reroll on the Primary Locomotion Table - Mountain with no "Immobile"
        I do not roll for a tertiary regardless of what I get for a secondary
        
- Alien Creation IV (GURPS Space pg. 151):

    Size Category - Modifiers for gravity
        does not specify modifier for gravities between 0.4G and 0.5G
        I apply +2 if gravity < 0.5, +1 if 0.5 <= gravity <= 0.75
        I think this is the intended behavior, if we don't assume we're
        generating gravity in tidy steps 

    Size and Mass text - mass and weight used inconsistently
        I have chosen to interpret "weight" as mass 
        and call the gravity-adjusted number weight
        
    Whole section - Size not clearly defined. Height? Length of longest axis? 
    Some measure of Volume?
        I have called it volume but I'm not really happy about it
        I think it might be length on longest axis, after thinking about it
        
    I have chosen to ignore the "Weight" column on the size tables, 
    and calculate as given in the text
        This simplifies the code greatly when attempting 
        to apply the "Gravity Effects" multipliers
        The whole process becomes very confusing if you try to apply 
        the text to the tables
        I suspect the tables are for a quick-and-dirty determination 
        when you aren't worrying about gravity
        
    Gravity table uses a set of discrete values which 
    actual gravity value can be between
        I have chosen to set the range for each value to be halfway 
        between the value and the next one
        
    Strength calculation can be a non-integer and does not specify minimum
    	I have chosen to round to nearest number and choose 
    	the maximum of 1 and the calculation result
    	
    Move (Walking) calculation comes from Gurps Space pg. 146, Walking
    	Rounding rules are not clear from the text 
    	I have left it unrounded and truncated at two decimal places
    	
    Move (Digging) calculation is in Gurps Basic pg. 350
    	Not yet included in this software
    	
- Alien Creation V (GURPS Space pg. 154):

	I represent sides, segments, and limbs all as separate numbers
		this does not necessarily fully indicate 
		e.g. limbs per side per segment
		
    It is possible to get "walking" creatures with no limbs
        or creatures that e.g. only slither but have a bunch of limbs
        I don't know how that would work, but I have left it in as there is
        not really any way to interpret it otherwise without deviating from
        the procedure in the book by adding my own modifiers or special cases
		
	Tails - Tail Features do not have all words capitalized
	  I have done so

	Tails - If Tail Features rolls "Combination" and both combination rolls 
    	come up the same, I just drop one
		The text does not indicate if this should be done 
		or if I should reroll until two uniques
	
	Manipulators - 'for Asymmetrical ogranisms replace a "pair" of limbs with
                	a single one'
        "Pair" and "set" appear to be used interchangably in the table
        I count an asymmetrical or spherical set as 1 manipulator per set
	
	Manipulators - Modifiers "-1 if winged or gliding"
    	There is no "gliding" previously defined so I ignore it and apply this
    	modifier if the creature has "winged flight" as a locomotion method
		
	Manipulators - Modifiers "+2 if Brachiator", 
    	but Brachiator is not present in earlier tables so I ignore this

    Manipulators - the logic in this section is kind of hard for me to parse
        I spent a long time working up something and I still don't really
        like it 100%, because the section is so unclear to me
        I'm not going to explain it here for now, maybe later
        For now, read Species._gen_body_manipulators() to see how I do it
	
	Skeleton - Table and text do not specify how to handle "Combination"
    	I roll twice on the table but only on 4 - 10 since computers can 
    	handle rolling a 7-sided die with no problems, and keep re-rolling 
    	until I get two unique skeleton types
	
- Alien Creation VI (GURPS Space pg. 157):

	Skin - Scales Table Modifier "Tunneling" does not exist on other tables
		I apply the modifier if the species has "Digging" locomotion 
		
	Breathing - "Aerial or land-dwelling organisms" is not defined elsewhere
		I consider a creature aerial 
    		if its locomotion contains "Winged Flight" or "Bouyant Flight"
    		and if its locomotion does not contain "Swimming"
		I consider a creature land-dwelling 
    		if its habitat type is not "Water"
			and if its locomotion does not contain "Swimming"
			
	Breathing - Space-Dwelling is not addressed
		I add a special "Doesn't Breathe (Space-Dwelling)" breathing, 
		because it's silly otherwise

    Breathing - Modifier "+2 if walking is primary or secondary locomotion"
        I add +2 if walking is included in locomotion at all (even tertiary)

	Breathing - Modifier "+2 if flying or climbing is secondary locomotion"
		Flying or Climbing can not be secondary locomotion types according to 
		Alien Creation III rules (pg. 149)
		I add +2 if flying or climbing is included in locomotion at all
		
- Alien Creation VII (GURPS Space pg. 161)

	Sexes - I don't check if the "roll twice" result gets the same result twice
	
	Strategy - earlier tables do not differentiate between 
	"Spawning" and "Pollinating"
		if gestation is "Spawning/Pollinating" 
		I apply the "Spwaning" multiplier to the offspring per litter
		
	Strategy - I include the range involved in my output, 
	I do not roll the given die and insert it
		I did that at first and I didn't like the look of it
		I apply the same "Spawning" multiplier to the 
		low and high bounds of the litter size
		
- Alien Creation VIII (GURPS Space pg. 164)

	Hearing - roll 11 indicates "Subsonic Hearing if Large"
		I also include Subsonic Hearing if size category is "Huge"
		
	Taste/Smell - it is not clear how to treat aquatic organisms' smell sense
		Do they just not smell? 
		If they roll high, do they have normal smell and acute taste?
		
	Special Senses - the table would allow for 
	e.g. Discriminatory Hearing on a deaf creature
		I do not allow special senses 
		if the related normal sense is too low (e.g. Blindness or Deafness)
		360 vision requires > Blindness
		Discriminatory Hearing requires > Hard of Hearing
		Peripheral Vision requires > Blindness
		Night Vision requires > Blindness
		Ultravision I allow with Blindness, 
    		I interpret it as they can only see in UV
		Detect (Heat) I allow with Blindness, 
    		I interpret it as they can only detect IR
		Other special senses I do not judge are tied to one of the basic senses
		
	Communication Channels - it is not clear to me how some of the 
	special senses could be communication channels
		I only allow Ultravision, Detect (Heat), Detect (Electric Fields), 
		and Scanning Sense (Radar) to be communication channels, 
		not the straight modifiers for the normal senses (e.g. 360 vision) 
		
	Communication Channels - I do not do combined communication channels
		because that would be a huge pain to deal with
	Communication Channels - it is not clear how to treat secondary 
    	communication channels with the same communication channel roll
	Communication Channels - due to the above two issues, if two or more 
    	comm channel rolls are equal
		I pick the one with the highest roll on its sense table
		if the sense table rolls are equal, I pick one at random
		
- Alien Creation IX (GURPS Space pg. 168)
	Social Organization - Pair-Bonded Mating organisms 
	can roll Solitary Social Organization
		I have left this as-is 
		
	Social Organization - Modifier "-1 if large size", 
    	I also include -1 Modifier if "Huge" size
    	
	Social Organization - 9-10 (Small Group) and 11 (Medium Group) 
		it is unclear what the purpose of the Troop, Pack, Herd breakdown is
			Small = 2d6 = 2 - 12, 
			Medium = 4d6 = 4 - 24, 
			Large = 1d6 * 10 = 10 - 60
		from text: Troop = 4 - 10, Pack = 6 - 20, Herd = 10 - 100+
		I have chosen to ignore the top line and just put Troop/Pack/Herd 
		+ numerical range from text
		
- Alien Creation X (GURPS Space pg. 169)
    Several - Modifier "if pair-bonded"
        I assume this refers to the social organization and not to mating
        behavior, since it is frequently paired with "solitary"

    Curiosity - Modifier "-1 for Blind or Nearly Blind species"
        I have interpreted "Blind" to mean species has "Blindness"
        and "Nearly Blind" to mean species has "Blindness (Can sense light...)"
        
    Egoism - Modifier "+1 for harem (males only)"
        I can't think of a good way to handle this, so I ignore it for now
    
    Suspicion - Modifier "+1 for Blind or Nearly Blind species"
        I have interpreted "Blind" to mean species has "Blindness"
        and "Nearly Blind" to mean species has "Blindness (Can sense light...)"
    
    Suspicion - Modifier "-1 for large"
        I have also included a -1 modifier for "Huge" size class
    
    Playfulness - Modifier "-3 if Cannot Learn"
        I check for if the IQ stat is < 2
        this covers both Cannot Learn and Mindless
        although it's debatable if Mindless creatures should have 
        any personality at all
        
    Suspicion - +2 "becomes Careful quirk if Curiosity is -3"
        I change it to Careful quirk if Curiosity < -2
