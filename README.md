# GURPS 4<sup>th</sup> Edition Space Alien Generator

This code can be found on GitHub: http://theoldestnoob/space-alien-gen/

## What is this?

This program was designed to assist GMs by quickly creating any number of alien species, using the rulebook **GURPS _Space_**. It can be used to generate alien species for other tabletop RPGs as well.

There is much more detail available on what every part of this program's output means in **GURPS _Space_**, as well as several options to include in your alien species which this program does not include.

**GURPS _Space_** is available here: http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/space/

## How do I use this?

### CLI Version
Install Python 3.
Download the code and put it into a folder.
From that folder, run the `space-alien-gen.py` script with the desired options.
Example: `python space-alien-gen.py --num 5 --earthlike --chem-basis Water-Based --size-class Human-Scale`

There are several options to customize the alien which is generated. A list of what command line options are available can be seen if the script is run with the -h or --help option: `python space-alien-gen.py --help`

### GUI Version
I will be adding a GUI in the future.

### Web Version
I will be adding a webserver interface in the future.

### Interactive Text (terminal) Version
I will be adding a terminal interface in the future.
