ToDo:

- TODO comments in the code

Program Structure
    - Break up some of the longer Creation functions to make them less unwieldy
    	I'm looking at you, Alien Creation V
    - see if it's possible to clean up some of the big combined conditionals 
        to make them more readable
    - Break up generation functions to minimum logical blocks
    - Add higher-level generation function that only calls
        sub-generation functions for empty variables
    - clean up planetinfo.py to remove unncessary getter functions
    - update planetinfo.py to generate truly random planets with reroll
    - update planetinfo.py to add ability to generate only default attributes
    - main program that calls ui script depending on options
        - no option = interactive text
        - variables = command line
        - webserver option = webserver
        - gui option = gui
    - change "<" to "<=" in most places to make dice rolls more readable

Data Structure
    - separate senses object/module
    - separate personality object/module
    - generate list of advantages/disadvantages separately from descriptors
    - flags for "land-dwelling" and "aerial"?

Best Practices
    - !!!WRITE TESTS!!!
    - !!!DOCUMENT!!!!
    - update to PEP8 and PEP20 style and best practices
    - clean up classes to better conform with Python best practices
    - clean up script names + directory structure

GitHub
    - write README.md
    - figure out how to only upload some of the things
    - upload to github
    - import todo.txt into GitHub issues bugtracking
    - get someone else to download and run it to make sure it works

Features
    - User Interface
    	- interactive text
    	- command line
    	- web
    	- gui
        - allow user to input specific planet info
        - allow user to input species attributes
            instead of randomly generating all of them
        - multiple output formats
            - basic text dump
            - csv dump
        	- separate descriptors, stats, advantages/disadvantages
    - Include Move (Digging) stat (GURPS Space pg. 147, GURPS Basic pg. 350)
    - Include Wing Span calculation for winged flyers
    - Include Lifespan calculation from pg. 159
    - optional features other than RAW - make sure to keep RAW compatibility
        - better support for Gas Giant, Space-Dwelling, Planetary Interior, 
            Magnetic, Exotic species?
            these are present in some tables but not others, 
            so the system won't roll them properly
            I have included them where I see them in the rules, 
            but they are pretty much just dead code right now
    - size support for huge creatures?
    - import planet info from starsystem-gen: 
        https://github.com/tschoppi/starsystem-gen
    - go through text and implement advantages/disadvantages noted
        where this is possible; some examples below
        - slithering creatures get "No Legs (Slithering)" pg 146

Possible Bugs
    - LOGIC ERROR: "carnivore" subtype won't catch "combined" trophic level
    	update all instances to account for Combined
    	is_carnivore function or variable?
    - sanity check some combos 
        (Large Mobile Deep-Ocean Vent Decomposers, Immobile Chasing Predators, 
        Cannibalistic Herbivores, "Mating-only no pair bond" pair-bonded, wtf?)
    - LOGIC ERROR: go through and make all "aquatic" checks 
        not just "habitat = water" 
    	(also include only locomotion = swimming?)
    	is_aquatic function or variable?
    - Check Winged Flight Secondary Locomotion calculation 
    	seems like I'm getting a lot of Winged Flight with 
    	no second or third locomotion methods
    - add check and warning if planets will not support any life 
        in the current system
        this case currently drops through to chemical basis = Exotica
